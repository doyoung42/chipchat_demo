Operating with an input range of 4.5V~65V, the JWH5123 series delivers 3.5A of continuous output current with an integrated high side N-Channel MOSFET. At light loads, the regulator operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency. Current mode control provides tight load transient response and cycle-by-cycle current limit.\n\nThe JWH5123 series guarantees robustness with short-circuit protection, thermal protection, current run-away protection, and input under voltage lockout.\n\nThe JWH5123 series is available in DFN4x4-10 package, the JWH5123S and JWH5123P are available in ESOP8 package, which provides a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n- 4.5V to 65V operating input range\n- 3.5A output current\n- 0.8V \u00b1 1% internal voltage reference (JWH5123)\n- 0.75V \u00b1 1% internal voltage reference (JWH5123S/JWH5123P)\n- Adjustable switching frequency\n- Power Good Indicator (JWH5123/JWH5123P)\n- External Soft-start (JWH5123/JWH5123S)\n- Adjustable UVLO and hysteresis\n- Current run-away protection\n- Short circuit protection\n- Thermal protection\n- Available in DFN4x4-10 package (JWH5123)\n- Available in ESOP8 package (JWH5123S/JWH5123P)\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- Industrial Automation and Motor Control\n- Vehicle Accessories: GPS Entertainment\n- USB Dedicated Charging Ports and Battery Chargers\n- 12-V, 24-V and 48-V Industrial, Automotive and Communications Power Systems",
