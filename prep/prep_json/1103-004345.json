Pin Function Table\nName 5-Lead SOT23 4-Ball WLCSP Function\nSCL 1 B1 Serial Clock\nGND 2 A2 Ground\nSDA 3 B2 Serial Data\nVCC 4 A1 Device Power Supply\nWP(1) 5 \u2014 Write-Protect\n\nNote: \n1. If the WP pin is not driven, it is internally pulled down to GND. In order to operate in a wide variety of\napplication environments, the pull\u2011 down mechanism is intentionally designed to be somewhat strong. Once\nthis pin is biased above the CMOS input buffer's trip point (~0.5 x VCC), the pull\u2011 down mechanism disengages.\nMicrochip recommends connecting this pin to a known state whenever possible.\n\n2.1 Serial Clock (SCL)\nThe SCL pin is used to provide a clock to the device and to control the flow of data to and from the device. Command\nand input data present on the SDA pin is always latched in on the rising edge of SCL, while output data on the SDA\npin is clocked out on the falling edge of SCL. The SCL pin must either be forced high when the serial bus is idle or\npulled high using an external pull-up resistor.\n\n2.2 Ground\nThe ground reference for the power supply. GND should be connected to the system ground.\n\n2.3 Serial Data (SDA)\nThe SDA pin is an open-drain bidirectional input/output pin used to serially transfer data to and from the device. The\nSDA pin must be pulled high using an external pull-up resistor (not to exceed 10 k\u03a9 in value) and may be wire-ORed\nwith any number of other open-drain or open-collector pins from other devices on the same bus.\n\n2.4 Device Power Supply (VCC)\nThe Device Power Supply (VCC) pin is used to supply the source voltage to the device. Operations at invalid VCC\nvoltages may produce spurious results and should not be attempted.\n\n2.5 Write-Protect (WP)\nThe write-protect input, when connected to GND, allows normal write operations. When the WP pin is connected\ndirectly to VCC, all write operations to the protected memory are inhibited.\nIf the pin is left floating, the WP pin will be internally pulled down to GND. However, due to capacitive coupling that\nmay appear in customer applications, Microchip recommends always connecting the WP pin to a known state. When\nusing a pull\u2011 up resistor, Microchip recommends using 10 k\u03a9 or less.",
