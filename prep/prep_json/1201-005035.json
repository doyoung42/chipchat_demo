      "content": "15.32 DC Offset Detection \nDuring normal operation, the amplifier circuit continuously monitors the DC offset. If the DC offset exceeds a specified threshold, the channel is placed in the Hi-Z state, a fault is reported to the I2C register, and the FAULTB pin is activated. \n\n15.33 Global Over-Temperature Warning (OTWG) and Over-Temperature Protection (OTPG) \nThe device offers four over-temperature warning levels (see the Register Map section for threshold values). When the junction temperature surpasses a warning level, the WARNB pin is activated unless the mask bit in the pin control register (address 0x19) is configured to disable this alert. \n\n15.34 Channel Over-Temperature Warning (OTWC) and Over-Temperature Protection (OTPC) \nIn addition to the Global Over-Temperature Warning (OTWG) and Over-Temperature Protection (OTPG), each output channel has individual over-temperature warning and protection functions. \n\n15.35 Undervoltage (UV) and Power-On-Reset (POR) \nThe RTQ9128DH-QA monitors the PVDD voltage threshold. When the voltage at the PVDDL/R pin drops below the programmable undervoltage threshold of 4V, the Undervoltage Protection (UVP) circuit immediately shuts down the output. \n\n15.36 Overvoltage (OV) and Load Dump \nThe RTQ9128DH-QA monitors the voltage thresholds of the PVDD and VBAT pins. When the voltage on the PVDDL/R pin or the VBAT pin rises above the overvoltage threshold of 27.5V, the OVP circuit immediately shuts down the output. \n\n15.37 Clip Detection \nClip detection is reported on the WARNB pin if a 100% duty-cycle PWM is sustained for a minimum number of PWM cycles as set by the Clip Window Register (address 0x73).",

It is recommended that these components be placed on the bottom layer of the EVB.",

Pins 2, 3, 12, 37, 46, 47, 56, and 57 are PVDD power pins for the 4-CH Class-D structure application. Place the filter capacitors as close as possible to the PVDD pins and use the shortest possible traces to connect these capacitors. Capacitors with smaller capacitance should be placed near the PVDD pins. To reduce parasitic inductance and resistance, use multiple vias to connect to the main ground. The optimal approach is to use vias that are directly connected to the Main GND. Before making this connection, ensure that the vias are isolated to prevent unintended connections with other grounds.",

The ground defined by the GVDDCD pin is AGND, and the placement of the capacitor is shown in the figure below. The AGND pin trace should first connect to the ground terminal of the capacitor, and then use a via (a conductive hole that connects different layers of the PCB) to connect to the Main GND. To achieve good audio quality, the ground connection of decoupling capacitors (VDDD caps) should be linked to DGND first before connecting to the main ground.
