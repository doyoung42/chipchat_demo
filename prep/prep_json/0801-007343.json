Do not exceed the maximum input voltage range found in the Absolute Maximum Ratings.\n\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either VCC or ground. The unused inputs can be directly terminated if the input is completely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input will be used sometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is used for a default state of LOW. The drive current of the controller, leakage current into the SN74ACT08-Q1 (as specified in the Electrical Characteristics), and the desired input transition rate limits the resistor size. A 10k \u03a9 resistor value is often used due to these factors.\n\nThe SN74ACT08-Q1 has CMOS inputs and thus requires fast input transitions to operate correctly, as defined in the Recommended Operating Conditions table. Slow input transitions can cause oscillations, additional power consumption, and reduction in device reliability.\n\n8.3.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will decrease the output voltage as specified by the VOH specification in the Electrical Characteristics. The ground voltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the output voltage as specified by the VOL specification in the Electrical Characteristics.\n\nPush-pull outputs that could be in opposite states, even for a very short time period, should never be connected directly together. This can cause excessive current and damage to the device.\n\nTwo channels within the same device with the same input signals can be connected in parallel for additional output drive strength.\n\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to VCC or ground.",

The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the device and electrically close to both the VCC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout section.\n2. Ensure the capacitive load at the output is \u2264 50pF. This is not a hard limit; by design, however, it will optimize performance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74ACT08-Q1 to one or more of the receiving devices.\n3. Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (VCC / IO(max))\u03a9. Doing this will prevent the maximum output current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings from being violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load measured in M\u03a9; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.\n4. Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates; the power consumption and thermal increase, however, can be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd Calculation.",

In many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage specifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more sense for the logic function or is more convenient.",

The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the device and electrically close to both the VCC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout section. 2. Ensure the capacitive load at the output is \u2264 50pF. This is not a hard limit; by design, however, it will optimize performance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74ACT08-Q1 to one or more of the receiving devices. 3. Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (VCC / IO(max))\u03a9. Doing this will prevent the maximum output current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings from being violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load measured in M\u03a9; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.",
