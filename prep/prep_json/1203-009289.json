The switch current limit prevents the device from high inductor current and from drawing excessive current from the battery or input voltage rail. Excessive current can occur with a shorted or saturated inductor or an overload or shorted output circuit condition. If the inductor current reaches the threshold ILIM, the high-side MOSFET is turned off and the low-side MOSFET is turned on to ramp down the inductor current with an adaptive off time. When this switch current limit is triggered 32 times, the device stops switching to protect the output. The device then automatically starts a new start-up after a typical delay time of 100\u00b5s has passed. This action is named HICCUP short-circuit protection. To avoid misoperation of the device at low input voltages, an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) is implemented, which shuts down the device at voltages lower than VUVLO. The device goes into thermal shutdown and stops switching when the junction temperature exceeds T JSD. When the device temperature falls below the threshold by 20\u00b0C, the device returns to normal operation automatically.",
