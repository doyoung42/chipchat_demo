Operating with an input range of 2.6V-6.0V, the JW5262NF delivers 2A of continuous output current with integrated P-Channel and N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency. At light loads, JW5262NF operates in forced CCM to maintain low output ripples.\n\nThe JW5262NF guarantees robustness with hiccup output short-circuit protection, start-up current run-away protection and input under voltage lockout, and thermal protection.\n\nThe JW5262NF is available in 5-pin SOT23-5 package, which provides a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n- 2.6V to 6.0V Operating Input Range\n- Up to 2A Output Current\n- Up to 97% Peak Efficiency\n- 1% Feedback Voltage Accuracy\n- Internal Soft-start\n- 1.5MHz Switching Frequency\n- Input Under Voltage Lockout\n- Current Run-away Protection\n- Short Circuit Protection\n- Thermal Protection\n- Available in SOT23-5 Package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- 5V or 3.3V Point of Load Conversion\n- Set Top Boxes\n- Telecom/Networking Systems\n- Storage Equipment\n- GPU/DDR Power Supply",
