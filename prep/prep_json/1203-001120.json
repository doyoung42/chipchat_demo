Operating with an input range of 4.5V~28V, JW5070 delivers 3A of continuous output current with two integrated N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. At light loads, the regulator operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency and low output ripples.\n\nJW5070 guarantees robustness with output short protection, thermal protection, current run-away protection, input under voltage lockout.\n\nJW5070 is available in TSOT23-6 package, which provide a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n\u2022 4.5V to 28V Operating Input Range\n\u2022 Integrated 80m\u03a9 and 40m\u03a9 MOSFETs\n\u2022 50uA Quiescent Current\n\u2022 0.596V\u00b11% Reference Voltage\n\u2022 Fixed 500kHz Switching Frequency\n\u2022 Accurate EN Control\n\u2022 Input Under Voltage Lockout\n\u2022 Current Run-away Protection\n\u2022 Output Short Protection\n\u2022 Thermal Protection\n\u2022 Available in TSOT23-6 Package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\u2022 Industrial Application: Appliance, Surveillance, E-meter\n\u2022 Enterprise System: Multifunction Printers\n\u2022 Personal Electronics: Monitors, Audios, TVs\n\u2022 General Purpose for Power Bus Supply",
