Initially, only the buck switch is active and the buck duty cycle increases to maintain output regulation as VIN decreases. When VIN is approximately equal to 15.5 V, the boost switch begins to operate with a low duty cycle. If VIN continues to fall, the boost switch duty cycle increases and the buck switch duty cycle decreases until they become equal at VIN = 13.2 V.\n\n7.4.1 Buck Mode Operation: VIN > VOUT\n\nThe LM25118-Q1 buck-boost regulator operates as a conventional buck regulator with emulated current mode control while VIN is greater than VOUT and the buck mode duty cycle is less than 75%. In buck mode, the LO gate drive output to the boost switch remains low.",

In buck-boost mode, both Q1 and Q2 are active for the same time interval each cycle. The inductor current ramps up (proportional to VIN) when Q1 and Q2 are active and ramps down through the recirculating diode during the off-time. The first order buck-boost transfer function is VOUT/VIN = D/(1 \u2013 D), where D is the duty cycle of Q1 and Q2. The LM25118-Q1 high voltage switching regulator features all of the functions necessary to implement an efficient high voltage buck or buck-boost regulator using a minimum of external components. A buck-boost regulator can maintain regulation for input voltages either higher or lower than the output voltage.",

A single pole response at the crossover frequency yields a very stable loop with 90 degrees of phase margin. The plots shown in Figure 21 through Figure 26 show the gain and phase diagrams of the design example. The overall bandwidth is lower in a buck-boost application due the compensation challenges associated with the right-half-plane zero. For a pure buck application, the bandwidth could be much higher.

        "content": "Buck or Buck-boost regulators operating with high-input voltage can dissipate an appreciable amount of power while supplying the required bias current of the IC. The VCC regulator must step-down the input voltage VIN to a nominal VCC level of 7 V. The large voltage drop across the VCC regulator translates into high power dissipation in the VCC regulator. There are several techniques that can significantly reduce this bias regulator power dissipation. The highest power dissipating components are the two power MOSFETs, the recirculating diode, and the output diode. The easiest way to determine the power dissipated in the MOSFETs is to measure the total conversion losses (PIN - POUT), then subtract the power losses in the Schottky diodes, output inductor and any snubber resistors. An approximation for the recirculating Schottky diode loss is: P = (1-D) \u00d7 IOUT \u00d7 VFWD (55) The boost diode loss is: P = IOUT \u00d7 VFWD (56)",
