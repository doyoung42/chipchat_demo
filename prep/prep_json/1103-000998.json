Therefore, if the previous read or write operation was to address 'n' (n is any legal address), the next current address read operation would access data from address n + 1.",

To perform this type of read operation, the byte address must first be set. This is done by sending the byte address to the 24XX as part of a write operation (R/W bit set to '0'). Once the byte address is sent, the master generates a Start condition following the acknowledge. This terminates the write operation, but not before the internal address counter is set. The master then issues the control byte again, but with the R/W bit set to a '1'. The 24XX will then issue an acknowledge and transmit the 8-bit data byte.\n\n8.3 Sequential Read\nSequential reads are initiated in the same way as a random read except that after the 24XX transmits the first data byte, the master issues an acknowledge as opposed to the Stop condition used in a random read. This acknowledge directs the 24XX to transmit the next sequentially addressed data byte (Figure 8-4). Following the final byte transmitted to the master, the master will NOT generate an acknowledge but will generate a Stop condition.",
