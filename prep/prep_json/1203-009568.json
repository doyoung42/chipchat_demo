      "content": "DESCRIPTION \nThe JW5188DH is a monolithic buck switching regulator based on I2 architecture for fast transient response. Operating with an input range of 4V~23V, JW5188DH delivers 8A of continuous output current with two integrated N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. At light loads, the regulator operates in selectable PFM/FCCM mode. \nJW5188DH guarantees robustness with output short protection, thermal protection, current run-away protection, and input under voltage lockout. JW5188DH is available in QFN2.5X2.5-16 package, which provides a compact solution with minimal external components. \n\nFEATURES \n- 4V to 23V Operating Input Range\n- 8A Continuous Output Current \n- Up to 95% Efficiency\n- PFM/FCCM Selectable at Light Load\n- 600kHz Switching Frequency\n- External Bypass Input\n- Programmable Valley Current Limit\n- Power Good Indicator\n- Input Under Voltage Lockout\n- Output Discharge Function\n- Current Run-away Protection\n- Output Short Hiccup Protection\n- Thermal Protection\n- RoHS Compliant and Halogen Free\n- Available in QFN2.5X2.5-16 Package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- Industrial and Commercial Low Power System\n- Notebook\n- LCD Monitors and TVs\n- Green Electronics/ Appliances",
