Operating with an input range of 4.5V~65V, JW5126 delivers 200mA of continuous output current with one integrated N-Channel MOSFET and one  integrated P-Channel MOSFET. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. In order to achieve high efficiency  at no load while maintaining output voltage regulation, JW5126 operates in low quiescent current and low frequency to maintain high efficiency.\n\nFEATURES\n- 4.5V to 65V Operating input Range\n- 200mA Output Current\n- Ultra High Efficiency at Light Load\n- Adjustable Peak Current Limit\n- Internal Soft-Start (SOT23-6)\n- External Soft-Start (DFN2X3-8)\n- Power Good Indicator (DFN2X3-8)\n- Adjustable UVLO and Hysteresis\n- Current Run-away Protection\n- Output Short Protection\n- Thermal Protection\n- Available in SOT23-6 and DFN2X3-8 Packages\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- MCU Supply in Wireless LED Lighting\n- Wireless Charger\n- Green Electronics/ Appliances\n- Point of Load Regulation for High-Performance DSPs\n- Industrial and Commercial Low Power Systems",
