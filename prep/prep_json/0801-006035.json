      "content": "The 74LVC1G08 is a single 2-input AND gate. Inputs can be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V devices. This feature allows the use of these devices as translators in mixed 3.3 V and 5 V applications.\n\nSchmitt trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall time. This device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using IOFF. The IOFF circuitry disables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is powered down.\n\n\u2022 Wide supply voltage range from 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n\u2022 High noise immunity\n\u2022 \u00b124 mA output drive (VCC = 3.0 V)\n\u2022 CMOS low power dissipation\n\u2022 Direct interface with TTL levels\n\u2022 Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n\u2022 IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n\u2022 Latch-up performance \u2264 250 mA",
