ICC vs Input Voltage\n\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in Recommended Operating Conditions. \nEach V CC pin should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single supply, a 0.1-\u03bcF capacitor is recommended; if there are multiple V CC pins, then a 0.01- \u03bcF or 0.022-\u03bcF capacitor is recommended for each power pin. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject different frequencies of noise. 0.1-\u03bcF and 1-\u03bcF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power pin as possible for best results.\n\n9.4 Layout\n9.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple bit logic devices, inputs must never float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused (for example, when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used, or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used). Such input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states.",
