The device uses COT control (Constant On Time) to achieve low power consumption mode and fast transient, operates with a switching frequency of 1.5 MHz. At light load conditions, it seamlessly enters Power Save Mode to reduce switching cycles and maintain high efficiency. Output voltage can be configured by VSET pin. For 1.8 V output, connects the VSET pin to GND. For other output voltages, connects resistor to VSET pin following values in Table 5. Sixteen internally set voltages can be selected. The NEX30606 provides an output current up to 600 mA. With input voltage up to 5.0 V, the devices supports multiple sources such as 2S to 3S Alkaline, 1S Li-MnO2, 1S Li-ion/Li-SOCL2.",
