      "content": "General Description\nThe DS28E80 is a user-programmable nonvolatile memory chip. In contrast to the floating-gate storage cells, the DS28E80 employs a storage cell technology that is resistant to gamma radiation. The DS28E80 has 248 bytes of user memory that are organized in blocks of 8 bytes. Individual blocks can be write-protected. Each memory block can be written 8 times. The DS28E80 communicates over the single-contact 1-Wire\u00ae bus at standard speed or overdrive speed. Each device has its own guaranteed unique 64-bit registration number that is factory programmed into the chip. The communication follows the 1-Wire protocol with a 64-bit registration number acting as node address in the case of a multiple-device 1-Wire network.\n\nApplications\n\u2022 Identification of Medical Consumables\n\u2022 Identification and Calibration Medical Tools/Accessories\n\nBenefits and Features\n\u2022 High Gamma Resistance Allows User-Programmable Manufacturing or Calibration Data Before Medical Sterilization\n    - Resistant Up to 75kGy (kiloGray) of Gamma Radiation\n    - Reprogrammable 248 Bytes of User Memory\n\u2022 Lower Block Size Provides Greater Flexibility in Programming User Memory\n    - Memory is Organized as 8-Byte Blocks\n    - Each Block Can Be Written 8 Times\n    - User-Programmable Write Protection for Individual Memory Blocks\n\u2022 Advanced 1-Wire Protocol Minimizes Interface to Just Single Contact\n\u2022 Compact Package and Single IO Interface Reduces Board Space and Enhances Reliability\n    - Unique Factory-Programmed, 64-Bit Identification Number\n    - Communicates at 1-Wire Standard Speed (15.3kbps max) and Overdrive Speed (76kbps max)\n    - Operating Range: 3.3V \u00b110%, -40\u00b0C to + 85\u00b0C Reading, 0\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C Writing\n    - \u00b18kV HBM ESD Protection (typ) for IO Pin\n    - 6-Pin TDFN Package",

      "content": "The DS28E80 combines 1984 bits of 8-times programmable radiation hard nonvolatile user memory, administration memory, protection memory, and a 64-bit ROM ID in a single chip. A data buffer assists when writing to the memory. Data is transferred serially through the 1-Wire protocol that requires only a single data lead and a ground return. The user memory can be write protected to prevent overwriting the memory data. The protection applies to individual memory blocks. To protect against adverse effects caused by bit errors, the communication relies on 16-bit CRCs that the DS28E80 generates at various places in the protocol. The master verifies the CRC and, when found correct, transmits a release byte (any value from 00h to FFh) to approve EEPROM programming cycle. In case of a CRC error, the master can abort the communication and start over. The device's 64-bit ROM ID can be used to electronically identify the object in which the DS28E80 is used. The ROM ID guarantees unique identification and functions as logical address in a multidrop 1-Wire network environment where multiple devices reside on a common 1-Wire bus and operate independently of each other. The main application of the DS28E80 is identification and monitoring of consumables for medical applications.",

The discussion of this bus system is broken down into three topics: hardware configuration, transaction sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types and timing). The 1-Wire protocol defines bus transactions in terms of the bus state during specific time slots that are initiated on the falling edge of sync pulses from the bus master.\n\nThe 1-Wire port of the DS28E80 is open drain with an internal circuit equivalent to that shown in Figure 7.\n\nA multidrop bus consists of a 1-Wire bus with multiple slaves attached. The DS28E80 supports both standard and overdrive communication speed of 15.3kbps (max) and 76kbps (max), respectively. The DS28E80 requires a pullup resistor of maximum 750\u03a9.\n\nThe idle state for the 1-Wire bus is high. If for any reason a transaction must be suspended, the bus must be left in the idle state if the transaction is to resume. If this does not occur and the bus is left low for more than 16\u00b5s (overdrive speed) or more than 120\u00b5s (standard speed), one or more devices on the bus could be reset.",
