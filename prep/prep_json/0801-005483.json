As shown in Figure 7-1 , a wettable flank can be dimpled or step-cut to provide additional surface area for solder adhesion which assists in reliably creating a side fillet. See the mechanical drawing for additional details.\n\n7.3.4 Clamp Diode Structure\nAs shown in Figure 7-2, the inputs and outputs to this device have both positive and negative clamping diodes.\n\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage to the device.

A wettable flank can be dimpled or step-cut to provide additional surface area for solder adhesion which assists in reliably creating a side fillet.",
