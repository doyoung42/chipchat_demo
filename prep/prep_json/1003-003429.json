The RT8306 has 48 Channels flexible PWM generators and independent 12-bit PWM brightness were control LED current for every channel. Moreover, it has one global high accurate 8-bit IDAC which sets the LED peak current. And 48 independent 8-bit DACs can be used to boost or decrease LED Current for high dynamic range application. The constant current sink channels on the LED drivers are capable of sinking 60mA of current and its level can be set by register address 0561 [7:0] from 5mA to 60mA. The RT8306 provides \u00b12% high accuracy current each channel. It also supports the local dimming and global dimming by independent PWM generators with programmable PWM duty cycle, period and delay.",
