The TSM36CA robustly shunts up to 20A of IEC 61000-4-5 fault current to protect systems from high power transients or lightning strikes. The TSM36CA device is rated to dissipate ESD strikes up to \u00b130kV (contact and air gap discharge) which exceeds the maximum level specified in the IEC 61000-4-2 international standard (Level 4).\nAdditionally, the TSM36CA is available in a small leaded SOT-23 (DBZ) package which is reduced in size by approximately 50 percent compared to the industry standard SMA package. The extremely low device leakage and capacitance ensures a minimal effect on the protected line.",

Connect the device in parallel to the down stream circuitry for protection. As the current from the transient passes through the device, only a small voltage drop is present across the diode. This is the voltage presented to the protected IC. The low RDYN of the triggered TVS holds this voltage (VCLAMP) to a safe level for the protected IC. For more information on how to properly use this device, refer to the ESD Packaging and Layout Guide for details.\n\nOne comon example of implementing TSM36CA is to protect both sides of a PLC module and a sensor transmitter, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[DIAGRAM SHOWING TYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT]",
