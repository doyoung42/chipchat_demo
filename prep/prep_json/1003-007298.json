The LED current can be controlled with an analog input voltage. \nWith high-side LED current sensing, the JW1130H can be configured as buck, boost or buck-boost topology to serve different LED driver need.\nThe integrated 44V/2A N-Channel MOSFET ensures high efficiency operation. \nAt light loads, JW1130H operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency and low output ripple.\nThe overvoltage lockout protection on SW pin protects JW1130H from open LED fault. JW1130H also has thermal protection at 140 \u00baC. The JW1130H is available in a 6-pin SOT23-6and a 8-pin ESOP8 package, which provides a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- 4.6V to 36V operating input range\n- 2A peak switch current\n- Analog dimming and PWM dimming\n- Constant off-time operation\n- SW over voltage lockout\n- Thermal protection\n- Available in SOT23-6 and ESOP8 packages\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- LED Drive",
