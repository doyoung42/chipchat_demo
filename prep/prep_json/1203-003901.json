Operating with an input range of 4V~23V, JW5079A delivers 10A of continuous output current with two integrated N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. At light loads, the regulator operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency and low output ripples.\nJW5079A guarantees robustness with output short protection, thermal protection, current run-away protection, and input under voltage lockout.\nJW5079A is available in QFN3\u00d73-20 package, which provide a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n- 4V to 23V operating input range\n- 10A continuous\n- Up to 95% efficiency\n- High efficiency at light load\n- 500kHz switching frequency\n- External bypass input\n- Programmable valley current limit\n- Power good indicator\n- Input under voltage lockout\n- Output discharge function\n- Output over voltage latch off protection\n- Output short protection\n- Thermal protection\n- Available in QFN3X3-20 package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- Industrial and commercial low power system\n- Notebook\n- LDO monitors and TVs\n- Green electronics/appliances",
