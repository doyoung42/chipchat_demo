      "content": "The W25Q128FW array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256-bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q128FW has 4,096 erasable sectors and 256 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See Figure 2.)\n\nThe W25Q128FW support the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI as well as 2-clocks instruction cycle Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) : Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clock frequencies of up to 104MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 208MHz (104MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 416MHz (104MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficient memory access with as few as 8-clocks of instruction-overhead to read a 24-bit address, allowing true XIP (execute in place) operation.",

SPI clock frequencies up to 104MHz are supported, allowing equivalent clock rates of 208MHz for Dual I/O and 416MHz for Quad I/O using Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode enables efficient memory access with as few as 8-clocks of instruction-overhead for true XIP (execute in place) operation.",
