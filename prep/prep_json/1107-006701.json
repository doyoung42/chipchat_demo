The upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Octal Word Read Quad I/O instruction through the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3-0) are don't care (\"x\"). However, the IO pins should be high-impedance prior to the falling edge of the first data out clock.",
