This lot or product specific information can be accessed with minimal interface, for example a single port pin of a microcontroller. The DS2430A consists of a factory -lasered registration number that includes a unique 48- bit serial number, an 8 -bit CRC, and an 8 -bit Family Code (14h) plus 256 bits of user -programmable EEPROM and a 64- bit one-time programmable application register. The power to read and write the DS2430A is derived ent irely from the 1 -Wire communication line. Data is transferred serially via the 1 -Wire protocol, which requires only a single data lead and a ground return.",

The data memory and the application register each have its own intermediate storage area called scratchpad that acts as a buffer when writing to the device. The data memory can be read and written as often as desired. The application register, however, is one-time programmable only. Once the application register is programmed, it is automatically write protected.",

      "content": "WRITE SCRATCHPAD [0Fh]\nAfter issuing the Write Scratchpad command, the master must first provide a 1-byte address, followed by the data to be written to the scratchpad for the data memory. The DS2430A automatically increments the address after every byte it receives. After having received a data byte for address 1Fh, the address counter wraps around to 00h for the next byte and writing continues until the master sends a Reset Pulse.\n\nREAD SCRATCHPAD [AAh]\nThis command is used to verify data previously written to the scratchpad before it is copied into the final storage EEPROM memory. After issuing the Read Scratchpad command, the master must provide the 1-byte starting address from where data is to be read. The DS2430A automatically increments the address after every byte read by the master. After the data at address 1Fh has been read, the address counter wraps around to 00h for the next byte and reading continues until the master sends a Reset Pulse.\n\nCOPY SCRATCHPAD [55h]\nAfter the data stored in the scratchpad has been verified the master may send the Copy Scratchpad command followed by a validation key of A5h to transfer data from the scratchpad to the EEPROM memory. This command always copies the data of the entire scratchpad. Therefore, if one desires to change only a few bytes of the EEPROM data, the scratchpad should contain a copy of the latest EEPROM data before the Write Scratchpad and Copy Scratchpad commands are issued. After this command and the validation key are issued, the data line must be held above VPUPmin for at least tPROG.\n\nREAD MEMORY [F0h]\nThe Read Memory command is used to read a portion or all of the EEPROM data memory and to copy the entire data memory into the scratchpad to prepare for changing a few bytes. To copy data from the data memory to the scratchpad and to read it, the master must issue the read memory command followed by the 1-byte starting address of the data to be read from the scratchpad. The DS2430A automatically increments the address after every byte read by the master. After the data of address 1Fh has been read, the address counter wraps around to 00h for the next byte and reading continues until the master sends a Reset Pulse. If one intends to copy the entire data memory to the scratchpad without reading data, a starting address is not required; the master may send a Reset Pulse immediately following the command code.",

When responding with a 1, the DS2430A does not hold the data line low at all, and the voltage starts rising as soon as tRL is over. The sum of tRL + \u03b4 (rise time) on one side and the internal timing generator of the DS2430A on the other side define the master sampling window (tMSRMIN to tMSRMAX) in which the master must perform a read from the data line.",
