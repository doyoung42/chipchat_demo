Connect the device in parallel to the down stream circuitry for protection. As the current from the transient passes through the TVS, only a small voltage drop is present across the diode. The small voltage drop is presented to the protected IC. The low R DYN of the triggered TVS holds this voltage (VCLAMP) to a safe level for the protected IC. For more information on how to properly use this device, refer to the ESD Packaging and Layout Guide.",
