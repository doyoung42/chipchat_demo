The protocol relies on the use of a Master device, which provides the clock and directs bus traffic, and Slave devices which execute requests. The CAT24C32BC4/CAT24C32BAC4 operates as a Slave device. Both Master and Slave can transmit or receive, but only the Master can assign those roles.",

      "content": "Byte Write\nTo write data to memory, the Master creates a START condition on the bus and then broadcasts a Slave address with the R/W bit set to '0'. The Master then sends two address bytes and a data byte and concludes the session by creating a STOP condition on the bus. The Slave responds with ACK after every byte sent by the Master (Figure 6). The STOP starts the internal Write cycle, and while this operation is in progress (tWR), the SDA output is tri-stated and the Slave does not acknowledge the Master (Figure 7).\n\nPage Write\nThe Byte Write operation can be expanded to Page Write, by sending more than one data byte to the Slave before issuing the STOP condition (Figure 8). Up to 32 distinct data bytes can be loaded into the internal Page Write Buffer starting at the address provided by the Master. The page address is latched, and as long as the Master keeps sending data, the internal byte address is incremented up to the end of page, where it then wraps around (within the page). New data can therefore replace data loaded earlier. Following the STOP, data loaded during the Page Write session will be written to memory in a single internal Write cycle (tWR).",

Upon receiving a NoACK response from the Slave, the Master simply repeats the request until the Slave responds with ACK.\n\nDelivery State\nThe CAT24C32BC4/CAT24C32BAC4 is shipped erased, i.e., all bytes are FFh.",
