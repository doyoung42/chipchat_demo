Step-Down Converter with Low IQ \n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe JW5143 and JW5143P are monolithic buck switching regulators based on COT architecture. Operating with an input range of 6V~100V, JW5143 and JW5143P integrate high-side N-Channel MOSFET with a peak current limit of 3.5A. At light loads, the regulator operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency. \nJW5143 and JW5143P guarantee robustness with output short protection, thermal protection, current run-away protection, input under voltage lockout. JW5143 and JW5143P are available in ESOP-8 package, which provide a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n- 6V to 100V Operating Input Range\n- 3.5A Peak Current Limit\n- Very Low Quiescent Current: 20uA\n- Fixed 300kHz Switching Frequency (JW5143)\n- Adjustable Switching Frequency from 100kHz to 600kHz (JW5143P)\n- Input Under Voltage Lockout\n- Current Run-away Protection\n- Output Short Protection\n- Thermal Protection\n- Available in ESOP-8 Package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- GPS Tracker\n- E-bike\n- Telecom/Networking Power",
