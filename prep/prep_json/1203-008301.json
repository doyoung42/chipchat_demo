      "content": "6.3.1 Oscillator Frequency\nThe internal free running oscillator sets the PWM switching frequency at 500 kHz. The 500 kHz switching frequency allows less output inductance for the same output ripple requirement resulting in a smaller output inductor.\n\n6.3.2 Voltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precision reference signal by scaling the output of a temperature stable bandgap circuit. The bandgap and scaling circuits are trimmed during production testing to an output of 1.221 V at room temperature.\n\n6.3.3 Enable (ENA) and Internal Slow Start\nThe ENA pin provides electrical on/off control of the regulator. After the ENA pin voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, the regulator starts operation and the internal slow start begins to ramp. If the ENA pin voltage is pulled below the threshold voltage, the regulator stops switching and the internal slow start resets. Connecting the pin to ground or to any voltage less than 0.5 V will disable the regulator and activate the shutdown mode. The quiescent current of the TPS543x in shutdown mode is typically 15 \u03bcA.\n\n6.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe TPS543x incorporate an undervoltage lockout circuit to keep the device disabled when VIN (the input voltage) is below the UVLO start voltage threshold. During power up, internal circuits are held inactive and the internal slow start is grounded until VIN exceeds the UVLO start threshold voltage. After the UVLO start threshold voltage is reached, the internal slow start is released and device start-up begins. The device operates until VIN falls below the UVLO stop threshold voltage. The typical hysteresis in the UVLO comparator is 350 mV.\n\n6.3.5 Boost Capacitor (BOOT)\nConnect a 0.01 \u03bcF low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the BOOT pin and PH pin. This capacitor provides the gate drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. X7R or X5R grade dielectrics are recommended due to their stable values over temperature.\n\n6.3.6 Output Feedback (VSENSE) and Internal Compensation\nThe output voltage of the regulator is set by feeding back the center point voltage of an external resistor divider network to the VSENSE pin. In steady-state operation, the VSENSE pin voltage must be equal to the voltage reference 1.221 V.\n\nThe TPS543x implements internal compensation to simplify the regulator design. Because the TPS543x uses voltage mode control, a type 3 compensation network has been designed on chip to provide a high crossover frequency and a high phase margin for good stability. See the Internal Compensation Network in the applications section for more details.\n\n6.3.7 Voltage Feed-Forward\nThe internal voltage feed-forward provides a constant dc power stage gain despite any variations with the input voltage. This greatly simplifies the stability analysis and improves the transient response. Voltage feed forward varies the peak ramp voltage inversely with the input voltage so that the modulator and power stage gain are constant at the feed forward gain...",

      "content": "The typical feed forward gain of TPS543x is 25.\n\n6.3.8 Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) Control\nThe regulator employs a fixed frequency pulse-width-modulator (PWM) control method. First, the feedback voltage (VSENSE pin voltage) is compared to the constant voltage reference by the high gain error amplifier and compensation network to produce a error voltage. Then, the error voltage is compared to the ramp voltage by the PWM comparator. In this way, the error voltage magnitude is converted to a pulse width which is the duty cycle. Finally, the PWM output is fed into the gate drive circuit to control the on-time of the high-side MOSFET.\n\n6.3.9 Overcurrent Limiting\nOvercurrent limiting is implemented by sensing the drain-to-source voltage across the high-side MOSFET. The drain to source voltage is then compared to a voltage level representing the overcurrent threshold limit. If the drain-to-source voltage exceeds the overcurrent threshold limit, the overcurrent indicator is set true.",

The typical VIN UVLO threshold is 5.3 V and the device can operate at input voltages down to the UVLO voltage. At input voltages below the actual UVLO voltage the device will not switch.\n\n6.4.2 Operation with ENA control\nThe enable start threshold voltage is 1.3 V max. With ENA held below the 0.5 V minimum stop threshold voltage the TPS543x is disabled and switching is inhibited even if VIN is above its UVLO threshold. The quiescent current is reduced in this state. If the ENA voltage is increased above the max start threshold while V (VIN) is above the UVLO threshold, the device becomes active. Switching is enabled and the slow-start sequence is initiated.",

The minimum recommended bypass capacitance is 4.7 \u03bcF ceramic with a X5R or X7R dielectric.\n\nThere must be a ground area on the top layer directly underneath the IC, with an exposed area for connection to the DAP. Use vias to connect this ground area to any internal ground planes. Use additional vias at the ground side of the input and output filter capacitors as well.

For proper thermal performance, the DAP underneath the device must be soldered down to the printed-circuit board. To calculate the minimum value of the output inductor, use Equation 4: LMIN = (VOUT(MAX) * (VIN(MAX) - VOUT)) / (VIN(max) * KIND * IOUT * FSW). For this design example use KIND = 0.2 and the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 12.5 \u03bcH. The next highest standard value is 15 \u03bcH, which is used in this design. The performance graphs ( Figure 7-2 through Figure 7-8) are applicable to the circuit in Figure 7-1. Ta= 25 \u00b0C. unless otherwise specified.",

The minimum recommended bypass capacitance is 4.7 \u03bcF ceramic with a X5R or X7R dielectric. There must be a ground area on the top layer directly underneath the IC, with an exposed area for connection to the DAP. Use vias to connect this ground area to any internal ground planes. Use additional vias at the ground side of the input and output filter capacitors as well. The GND pin must be tied to the PCB ground by connecting it to the ground area under the device.",
