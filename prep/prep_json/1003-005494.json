Operating with an input range of 4.5-20V, JW1120 delivers 2A of continuous output current with two integrated N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. At light loads, the LED driver operates in low frequency to maintain high efficiency and low output ripple.\n\nThe JW1120 guarantees robustness with LED short protection, thermal protection, start-up current run-away protection, input under voltage lockout.\n\nThe JW1120 is available in 6-pin and 8-pin TSOT packages, which provide a compact solution with minimal external components.\n\nFEATURES\n- 4.5V to 20V operating input range\n- 2A output current\n- Up to 94% efficiency\n- High efficiency (>85%) at light load\n- Fixed 1MHz Switching frequency\n- Input under voltage lockout\n- Start-up current run-away protection\n- LED short protection\n- Thermal protection\n- Available in TSOT23-6 and TSOT23-8 packages\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- LED Driver",
