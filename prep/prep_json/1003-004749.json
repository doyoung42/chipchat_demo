Operating with an input range of 4.5V-28V, JW1123 delivers 2A of continuous output current with two integrated N-Channel MOSFETs. The internal synchronous power switches provide high efficiency without the use of an external Schottky diode. It integrates PWM signal to analogy dimming mode to achieve dimmable LED lighting application. \nThe JW1123 guarantees robustness with LED short protection, thermal protection, start-up current run-away protection, input under voltage lockout.\n\nFEATURES\n- 4.5V to 28V Operating Input Range\n- 2A Output Current\n- Up to 94% Efficiency @ Vin=12V, Vout=6V, ILED=2A\n- 600kHz Switching Frequency\n- Input Under Voltage Lockout\n- Start-up Current Run-away Protection\n- LED Short Protection\n- Thermal Protection\n- Available in SOT23-6 Package\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n- IP camera and CCD camera\n- Flash light\n- Display cabinet lamp\n- General LED lighting",
