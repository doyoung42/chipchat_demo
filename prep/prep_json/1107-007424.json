      "content": "The W25Q512JV (512M-bit) Serial Flash memory  provides a storage solu tion for systems with limited space, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operate s on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 1\u00b5A for power-down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages.\n\nThe W25Q512JV array is organized into 262,144 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q512JV has 16,384 erasable 4KB sectors and  1,028 erasable 64KB blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage.\n\nThe W25Q512JV supports the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2, and I/O3. SPI clock frequencies of W25Q512JV of up to 133MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz (133MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 532MHz (133MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Rea d Dual/Quad I/O. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories.\n\nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID and SFDP Register , a 64-bit Unique Serial Number and three 256-bytes Security Registers.",
