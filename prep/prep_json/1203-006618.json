      "content": "7.3.10 Overvoltage Transient Protection\nThe TPS54331 device incorporates an overvoltage transient-protection (OVTP) circuit to minimize output voltage overshoot when recovering from output fault conditions or strong unload transients. The OVTP circuit includes an overvoltage comparator to compare the VSENSE pin voltage and internal thresholds. When the VSENSE pin voltage goes above 109% \u00d7 V REF, the high-side MOSFET is forced off. When the VSENSE pin voltage falls below 107% \u00d7 VREF, the high-side MOSFET is enabled again.\n\n7.3.11 Thermal Shutdown\nThe device implements an internal thermal shutdown to protect the device if the junction temperature exceeds 165\u00b0C. The thermal shutdown forces the device to stop switching when the junction temperature exceeds the thermal trip threshold. When the die temperature decreases below 165\u00b0C, the device reinitiates the power-up sequence.\n\n7.4.1 Eco-mode\nThe TPS54331 device is designed to operate in pulse skipping Eco-mode at light load currents to boost light load efficiency. When the peak inductor current is lower than 160 mA (typical), the COMP pin voltage falls to 0.5 V (typical) and the device enters Eco-mode. When the device is in Eco-mode, the COMP pin voltage is clamped at 0.5 V internally, which prevents the high-side integrated MOSFET from switching. The peak inductor current must rise above 160 mA for the COMP pin voltage to rise above 0.5 V and exit Eco-mode. Because the integrated current comparator catches the peak inductor current only, the average load current entering Eco-mode varies with the applications and external output filters.",

Take care to minimize the loop area formed by the bypass capacitor connections, the VIN pin, and the anode of the catch diode. The typical recommended bypass capacitor is 10- \u03bcF ceramic with a X5R or X7R dielectric and the optimum placement is closest to the VIN pins and the source of the anode of the catch diode. Figure 8-16 shows a PCB layout example. The GND pin must be tied to the PCB ground plane at the pin of the device. The source of the low-side MOSFET must be connected directly to the top-side PCB ground area used to tie together the ground sides of the input and output capacitors as well as the anode of the catch diode. The PH pin must be routed to the cathode of the catch diode and to the output inductor. Because the PH connection is the switching node, the catch diode and output inductor must be located very close to the PH pins, and the area of the PCB conductor minimized to prevent excessive capacitive coupling. For operation at full rated load, the top-side ground area must provide adequate heat dissipating area. The TPS54331 device uses a fused lead frame so that the GND pin acts as a conductive path for heat dissipation from the die. Many applications have larger areas of internal or back-side ground plane available, and the top-side ground area can be connected to these areas using multiple vias under or adjacent to the device to help dissipate heat. The additional external components can be placed approximately as shown. Obtaining acceptable performance with alternate layout schemes can be possible, however this layout has been shown to produce good results and is intended as a guideline.",

The peak current must be greater than IOUT(MAX) plus half the peak-to peak-inductor current. The forward-voltage drop must be small for higher efficiencies. The catch diode conduction time is (typically) longer than the high-side FET on time, so attention paid to diode parameters can make a marked improvement in overall efficiency. Additionally, check that the selected device is capable of dissipating the power losses. For this design, a Diodes, Inc.
