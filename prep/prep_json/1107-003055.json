      "content": "Product Description\nSST's 25 series Serial Flash family features a four-wire, SPI-compatible interface that allows for a low\npin-count package which occupies less board space and ultimately lowers total system costs. The\nSST25VF016B devices are enhanced with improved operating frequency and even lower power con-\nsumption than the original SST25VFxxxA devices. SST25VF016B SPI serial flash memories are man-\nufactured with SST's proprietary, high-performance CMOS SuperFlash technology. The split-gate cell\ndesign and thick-oxide tunneling injector attain better reliability and manufacturability compared with\nalternate approaches.\nThe SST25VF016B devices significantly improve performance and reliability, while lowering power\nconsumption. The devices write (Program or Erase) with a single power supply of 2.7-3.6V for\nSST25VF016B. The total energy consumed is a function of the applied voltage, current, and time of\napplication. Since for any given voltage range, the SuperFlash technology uses less current to pro-\ngram and has a shorter erase time, the total energy consumed during any Erase or Program operation\nis less than alternative flash memory technologies.\nThe SST25VF016B device is offered in both 8-lead SOIC (200 mils) and 8-contact WSON (6mm x\n5mm) packages.
