      "content": "The TPS92541-Q1 device contains a synchronous BOOST controller and a monolithic synchronous buck LED driver with a wide 4.5V to 65V operating BUCK input voltage range.\n\nThe synchronous BOOST controller implements a peak current-mode controller to operate in constant voltage mode. The Boost can be programmed to operate as dual-phase, or three-phase together with other TPS92541-Q1 devices. The output voltage can be programmed using a programmable 8-bit DAC.\n\nThe monolithic synchronous BUCK implements an adaptive on-time average current mode control and is designed to generate constant voltage (CV) or constant current (CC) output. In the CC mode, the BUCK is compatible with shunt FET dimming techniques and LED matrix manager-based dynamic beam headlamps. In CV mode, the adaptive on-time control enables high bandwidth operation with fast transient response.",
