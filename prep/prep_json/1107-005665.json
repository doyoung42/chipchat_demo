        "content": "The W25N01GV (1G-bit) Serial SLC NAND Flash Memory is a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power. It incorporates the popular SPI interface and the traditional large NAND non-volatile memory space. It is ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code directly from Dual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with low current consumption.",
