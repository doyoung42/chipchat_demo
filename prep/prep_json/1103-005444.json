TEST CONDITIONS\n\nPower-On Reset (POR)\nEach CAT24Cxx* incorporates Power-On Reset (POR) circuitry which protects the internal logic against powering up in the wrong state.\n\nPin Description\nSCL: The Serial Clock input pin accepts the Serial Clock generated by the Master.\nSDA: The Serial Data I/O pin receives input data and transmits data stored in EEPROM. In transmit mode, this pin is open drain. Data is acquired on the positive edge, and is delivered on the negative edge of SCL.\nA0, A1 and A2: The Address inputs set the device address when cascading multiple devices. When not driven, these pins are pulled LOW internally.\nWP: The Write Protect input pin inhibits all write operations, when pulled HIGH. When not driven, this pin is pulled LOW internally.\n\nFunctional Description\nThe CAT24Cxx supports the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Bus data transmission protocol, which defines a device that sends data to the bus as a transmitter and a device receiving data as a receiver. Data flow is controlled by a Master device, which generates the serial clock and all START and STOP conditions. The CAT24Cxx acts as a Slave device. Master and Slave alternate as either transmitter or receiver.",

For normal Read/Write operations, the first 4 bits of the Slave address are fixed at 1010 (Ah). The next 3 bits are used as programmable address bits when cascading multiple devices and/or as internal address bits. The last bit of the slave address, R/W, specifies whether a Read (1) or Write (0) operation is to be performed. The 3 address space extension bits are assigned as illustrated in Figure 3. A2, A1 and A0 must match the state of the external address pins, and a10, a9 and a8 are internal address bits.\n\nAcknowledge\nAfter processing the Slave address, the Slave responds with an acknowledge (ACK) by pulling down the SDA line during the 9th clock cycle (Figure 4). The Slave will also acknowledge the address byte and every data byte presented in Write mode. In Read mode the Slave shifts out a data byte, and then releases the SDA line during the 9th clock cycle. As long as the Master acknowledges the data, the Slave will continue transmitting. The Master terminates the session by not acknowledging the last data byte (NoACK) and by issuing a STOP condition. Bus timing is illustrated in Figure 5.",
