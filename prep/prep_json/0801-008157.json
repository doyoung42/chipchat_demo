In many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage specifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device.

        "content": "The SN74LVC7032A-Q1 can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to 50pF while still meeting all of the data sheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied; however, it is not recommended to exceed 50pF. The SN74LVC7032A-Q1 can drive a load with total resistance described by R L \u2265 VO / IO, with the output voltage and current defined in the Electrical Characteristics table with VOH and VOL. When outputting in the HIGH state, the output voltage in the equation is defined as the difference between the measured output voltage and the supply voltage at the VCC pin.",

        "content": "1. Add a decoupling capacitor from VCC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the device and electrically close to both the VCC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout Example section. 2. Ensure the capacitive load at the output is \u2264 70pF. This is not a hard limit; by design, however, it will optimize performance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74LVC7032A-Q1 to the receiving device. 3. Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (VCC / IO(max)) \u03a9, so that the maximum output current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load measured in mega ohms; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.",
