      "content": "5 Device operation\nThe device supports the I2C protocol. This is summarized in Figure 5. Any device that sends data on to the bus is defined to be a transmitter, and any device that reads the data is defined to be a receiver. The device that controls the data transfer is known as the bus master, and the other as the slave device. A data transfer can only be initiated by the bus master, which will also provide the serial clock for synchronization. The device is always a slave in all communications.\n\n5.1 Start condition\nStart is identified by a falling edge of serial data (SDA) while serial clock (SCL) is stable in the high state. A start condition must precede any data transfer instruction. The device continuously monitors (except during a Write cycle) serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL) for a start condition.\n\n5.2 Stop condition\nStop is identified by a rising edge of serial data (SDA) while serial clock (SCL) is stable in the high state. A Stop condition terminates communication between the device and the bus master. A Read instruction is terminated by no ACK followed by a stop condition to force the device into the standby mode.\nA stop condition at the end of a write instruction triggers the internal write cycle.",

For correct device operation,serial data (SDA) must be stable during the rising edge of serial clock (SCL), and the serial data (SDA) signal must change only when serial clock (SCL) is driven low.\n\n5.4 Acknowledge bit (ACK)\nThe acknowledge bit is used to indicate a successful byte transfer. The bus transmitter, whether it be bus master or slave device, releases serial data (SDA) after sending eight bits of data. During the 9th clock pulse period, the receiver pulls serial data (SDA) low to acknowledge the receipt of the eight data bits.\n\n5.5 Device addressing\nTo start communication between the bus master and the slave device, the bus master must initiate a start condition. Following this, the bus master sends the device select code and byte address as specified in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.",

The ECC logic is implemented on each group of four EEPROM bytes. Inside a group, if a single bit out of the four bytes happens to be erroneous during a read operation, the ECC detects this bit and replaces it with the correct value. The read reliability is therefore much improved. Even if the ECC function is performed on groups of four bytes, a single byte can be written/cycled independently. In this case, the ECC function also writes/cycles the three other bytes located in the same group (a group of four bytes is located at addresses [4*N, 4*N+1, 4*N+2, 4*N+3], where N is an integer.) As a consequence, the maximum cycling budget is defined at group level and the cycling can be distributed over the 4 bytes of the group: the sum of the cycles seen by byte 0, byte 1, byte 2 and byte 3 of the same group must remain below the maximum value defined in Table 10.",
